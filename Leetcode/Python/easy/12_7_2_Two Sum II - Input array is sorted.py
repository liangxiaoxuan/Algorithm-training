# Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order,
# find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
#
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
# where index1 must be less than index2.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2
