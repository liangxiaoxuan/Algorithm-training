# Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
#
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

# Example 2:
#
# Input: x = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
