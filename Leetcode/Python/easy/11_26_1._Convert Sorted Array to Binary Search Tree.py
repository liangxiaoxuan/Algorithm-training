# Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
#
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
#
# Example:
#
# Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
#
# One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
#
#       0
#      / \
#    -3   9
#    /   /
#  -10  5

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
